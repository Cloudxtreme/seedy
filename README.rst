Seedy
=========

Seedy scratches an itch about the relative inflexibility of Debian-based preseeds, specifically around using different 'profiles' and allowing individualized machine profiles without large amounts of effort on the part of the admin.  It spawned out of a larger, long-term project (romgrid) designed to provide fully-automated self-healing clouds/grids.

The initial goals of Seedy are: 
* Allow for customized preseeds which can be dynamically served to machines during automated install
* Provide admins the ability to build preseed files using a web interface
* Provide a 'post' install script that will allow admins to easily add additional install-time automation in a simple and efficient manner
